K34 -- Another DB Perspective
2022-05-01

- It's really frequent in my experience to have a database structure planned, implemented, and
then require large changes as it was not completely and properly conceptualized before it was
implemented
- Interesting how fast the scope and range of the tasks that our application needs to be able to
handle expands so much as more users might use it - applications with millions of users around the
world must struggle a lot
- The data diagrams and structure plans are much more complex than the ones that we have
conceptualized in class, but even so, are not that much more complicated
- Data models adjust to suit the requirements as demanded by the application, in a loop of expansion
in userbase and data models
