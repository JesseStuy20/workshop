K36 -- Another DB Perspective
2022-05-07

- BSON stores JSON in binary form is desired, and is faster/more efficient than JSON
- MongoDB stores data as BSON (machine readable) and displays it as BSON (human readable)
- mongoimport and mongoexport works with json, mongorestore and mongodump works with BSON
- Database collections can be filtered for documents with specific field and value pairs
- db.collection.find({ field : value }) works similarly for the shell
- it can be used to iterate 
- .count() can be used to find the number of documents matching the input
- .pretty() makes things easier to read
