K35 -- Another DB Perspective
2022-05-07

- MongoDB is a noSQL database, so the data is not stored in tables of rows and columns
- Data is instead stored in collections of documents
- These documents stored data similar to json files, python dictionaries, and js objects
in field-value pairs
- Atlas is a tool that facilitates the storage and retrieval of data in MongoDB
- Data can be stored in Atlas through clusters, which are configured as replica set
