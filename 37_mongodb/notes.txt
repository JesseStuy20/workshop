K36 -- Another DB Perspective
2022-05-10

- Objects have unique ObjectID values, which distinguish them from other documents in a
collection (default value if none is inputted)
- --drop can be used to remove duplicates to resolve a duplicate error
- .findOne() can be used to quickly get one random document from the collection
- documents with identical "_id" values cannot exist
- .insert([]) can be used to add multiple documents to a collection
- documents in collections can be updated relatively easily just by chaning values with edit
- updateOne() and updateMany() can be used to update documents in collections matching a query
- updateMany({query},{"$inc"(increment),{"field",incrementValue}})
- Can use "$set" to change values, "$push" to add an element to an array
- deleteOne() and deleteMany() can be used to delete documents in collections matching a query
- drop() to remove collections
