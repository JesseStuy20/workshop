Notable Things:

- the how-to guide was pretty useful, except for a few parts that were confusing
- for simplicity, the app folder should be located in the /var/www directory (not required but easier)
- the __init__.py file should be edited so that instead of solely app.run(), it reads if __name__ == "__main__": before it
- running less -S /path/error.log is less practical than simplying catting the error log file

Questions:
- how will databases react when multiple users are reading and committing to it at the same time?
