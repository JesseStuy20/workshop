* How do we read CSV Files?
    * To read the file, we first opened the file and stored the data in the file as a reader object, where the values in the row were stored as values in a list.
    * We then looped through the lists from our csv file and stored them into the dictionary that we made, with the job classes as the keys and the percentages as the values.
* What are dictionarys good for?
    * A dictionary is used to store data values organized by the name of the key.
    * It's easy to add new keys and values into the dictionary, as well as new values to existing keys.
    * Unlike other data structures, dictionaries can hold multiple values as one element because of the key:value pair.
    * Unlike lists, dictionaries make it easy to access data even when keys and values are added or deleted.
* How are dictionarys used?
    * These data values can be retrived by putting the name of the key as a parameter in the dictionary.
    * The keys() method returns all of the keys in the dictionary.
    * The keys and the values in the dictionary can looped through for easy access to the data in the dictionary.
    * The keys and values in the dictionary that are stored in the dictionary are unordered, meaning that the order that the keys and values are inputted is insignificant.
* What are lists good for?
    * A list is used to store values as different indexes.
    * Compared to dictionaries, the elements in the list are in order
* How does weighted randomized selection work?
    * We generated a random number that was within 0 and the total percentage in the csv file
