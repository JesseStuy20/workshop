*What does echo mean? to print what the user inputted
**What is a request method? The 'Get' and 'Post' methods

Predictions:
-When you're in default page of website ("/"), terminal prints out...
  -app Flask object, request, the arguments of request, and the header of request
  -request is just another module of Flask (like render_template)
  - "Waaaa hooo...." is printed in webpage
  
  *In authenicate, the requests won't be asked because there's no render_template(<template>)
  
Observations:
-There was only 1 input box when we ran the "/" page - but there are two input <> in HTML file
  -*Removing second input line in HTML file removes the "Submit Query" button!! (can still submit using /enter/)
  -If you click on "Submit Query" --> user is brought to /auth page
  -Why? Because <form action="/auth"> makes the form perform this action when the code inside <form> </form> is executed
